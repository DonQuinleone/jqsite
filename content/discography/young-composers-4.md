> Imaginative ideas from 4 composers, fully committed responses from these young singers, impressively performed and recorded<br>
> ~ <cite>Andrew McGregor, BBC Radio 3 Record Review</cite>

> The National Youth Choir of Great Britain and its Fellowship ensemble rise to the challenges of exposed lines, vocal drones and extended techniques, delivering superb dynamic control and ensemble tuningâ€¦.the range of concepts explored makes this a dynamic and engaging collection.<br>
> ~ <cite>BBC Music Magazine</cite>

> Crystalline singing from the National Youth Choir of Great Britain
> ~ <cite>Georgia Mann, BBC Radio 3 Essential Classics</cite>

> The performances on the disc are uniformly terrific and this is music that takes no prisoners....a dazzling kaleidescope of pieces, it is clear that all four composers are not only talented but each seems to have a clear idea of their voice and what they want to achieve. I look forward to hearing more from them.
