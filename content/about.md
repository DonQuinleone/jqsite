Josh Quinlan is a Dorset-based musician and audio producer, known for his multifaceted work across performance and production. Originally from Liverpool, he has Oculocutaneous Albinism and is registered blind - a lived experience that has profoundly shaped his sensitivity to sound and musical instinct. He maintains a busy schedule of freelance recording and performance work, whilst running [Endelium Records](https://endelium.com) (an independent classical record label and music distribution company), managing [National Youth Choir Recordings](https://www.nationalyouthchoir.org.uk/recordings), and working in the Web Hosting industry.

Recent projects have included collaborations with [Siglo de Oro](https://www.siglodeoro.co.uk/), [London Youth Choirs](https://www.londonyouthchoirs.com/), the [National Youth Choir](https://www.nationalyouthchoir.org.uk), [Joanna Forbes L'Estrange](https://www.joannaforbeslestrange.com/) & [Alexander L'Estrange](https://www.alexanderlestrange.com/), [Ben Parry](https://benparry.net), [Ralph Allwood MBE](https://ralphallwood.com/), and the [Gabrieli Consort](https://www.gabrieli.com/), including premiere recordings of new music by composers including [Roderick Williams OBE](https://www.grovesartists.com/artist/roderick-williams/), [Ben Rowarth](https://www.benrowarth.com/), [Joanna Marsh](https://joannamarsh.co.uk/), [Sarah Quartel](https://www.sarahquartel.com/), [Jamie Cullum](https://www.jamiecullum.com/), [Roxanna Panufnik](https://roxannapanufnik.com/), [Eric Whitacre](https://ericwhitacre.com/), and [Errollyn Wallen CBE](https://www.errollynwallen.com/).

An experienced choral musician and singer himself, Josh specialises in working with choirs, vocal ensembles, and soloists, with a particular passion for recording New Music. His production style is defined by clarity, depth, and a naturalistic sound that captures the emotional immediacy of performance while preserving the acoustic integrity of the space. As a performer-producer, he brings a rare dual perspective to the studio, enabling him to communicate with artists effectively and support them in achieving recordings of exceptional nuance and quality.

Josh began his musical training at the [Royal Northern College of Music](https://rncm.ac.uk)’s Junior Department, studying Singing, Conducting, Composition, Clarinet (with a focus on Bass Clarinet), and Advanced Musicology. During his time there, he received several awards for Composition and was honoured with the Percy Welton Prize for Academic Music. He went on to read Music at the [University of York](https://york.ac.uk), graduating with First-Class Honours in 2021.

As a former member of both the [Royal Liverpool Philharmonic](https://liverpoolphil.com) Youth Orchestra - where he was Principal Auxiliary Clarinettist (2016-2017) & Principal Clarinettist (2017-2019) - and the [National Youth Choirs of Great Britain](https://www.nationalyouthchoir.org.uk), initially in the Training Choir (2016–2018), and later in the National Youth Choir and Chamber Choir (2018–2023), Josh has built a career firmly grounded in performance. He is presently a Young Conductor on the National Youth Choir's Emerging Professional Artists programme, and also works with them as an audio producer and section coach. In parallel, he has composed award-winning works for numerous institutions and ensembles, including [Tate Modern](https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern), the [Royal Liverpool Philharmonic](https://liverpoolphil.com) (with whom he was a Composer on their Rushworth scheme between 2016 and 2018), the Wilfred Owen Commemoration Festival, and mezzo-soprano [Jennifer Johnston](https://www.jenniferjohnstonmezzo.com/).

At age 18, Josh made his conducting debut at the [Royal Albert Hall](https://www.royalalberthall.com), performing his own music with musicians from the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic. Further performance highlights include the [BBC Proms](https://www.bbc.co.uk/proms), [Ryedale Festival](https://ryedalefestival.com/), the [Royal Variety Performance](https://www.royalvarietycharity.org/royal-variety-performance-home), and the Royal Albert Hall’s 150th Anniversary Concert.
