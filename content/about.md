Josh Quinlan is a multifaceted musician based in Dorset, known for his work as an audio producer and baritone. Originally from Liverpool, he has been registered blind since birth due to Oculocutaneous Albinism — a lived experience that has shaped his sensitivity to sound and deep musical instinct.

Josh specialises in working with choirs, vocal ensembles and singers, with a particular interesting in recording new music. His passion lies in capturing the emotional immediacy and detail of live performance, while preserving the acoustic integrity of the space in which it was performed. His production style is defined by clarity, depth, and a naturalistic sound — one that respects the performers’ artistry without overproduction.

An experienced choral musician himself, Josh brings a performer's insight to the studio. Having sung in countless concerts and recording sessions, he understands both the technical demands and emotional nuance of performance. This dual perspective enables him to support and communicate with singers effectively while delivering recordings of the highest quality.

He began his musical training at the Royal Northern College of Music’s Junior Department, studying singing, conducting, composition, and clarinet, before earning a First-Class Honours degree in Music from the University of York.

Josh has worked with a wide range of renowned ensembles and organisations. He was selected for the prestigious Glyndebourne Academy, where he received mentorship as a young soloist of exceptional potential. At eighteen, he made his conducting debut at the Royal Albert Hall, performing his own music with young musician's from Royal Liverpool Philharmonic (who were also the commissioner). He is presently a Young Conductor on National Youth Choir's Emerging Professional Artists Programme. Performance highlights include appearances at the BBC Proms, the Royal Variety Performance, and the Royal Albert Hall’s 150th Anniversary Concert.

Josh is also the founder of Endelium Records - an independent classical label and distribution company supporting emerging artists and ensembles, with a focus on choral and vocal repertoire. Through this and his work managing National Youth Choir's in-house record label, National Youth Choir Recordings, he continues to advocate for new music, nurture creative talent, and broaden access to professional recording opportunities within the choral field.
