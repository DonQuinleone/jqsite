Josh Quinlan, originally from Liverpool and now based in Dorset, is a multifaceted musician know for his work as a producer, conductor, and baritone. As someone that has been registered blind since birth (with Oculocutaneous Albinism), Josh has developed an extraordinary sensitivity to sound and an innate musicality, hence his choice of career!

He completed his foundational training in singing, conducting, composition and clarinet at the Royal Northern College of Music’s esteemed Junior Department before moving to York to undertake a Bachelor’s degree in Music at the University of York , for which he gained first class honours.

Since then, Josh has performed with numerous top ensembles and artists, and was identified as a rising talent by Glyndebourne who selected him to receive intensive training, mentorship, and support on their Glyndebourne Academy programme – a prestigious scheme for young soloists who show ’exceptional potential’.

He made his Royal Albert Hall conducting debut at the age of eighteen performing Songs of Stone, a work written by Josh by commission of Royal Liverpool Philharmonic. Other prestigious performances have included appearances at the BBC Proms , Royal Variety Performance , the Royal Albert Hall ’s 150th Anniversary concert, and numerous other national and international music festivals.

Josh is proud to have been nurtured by numerous fantastic organisations including the likes of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and the National Youth Choir, the latter of which he now works for as a section coach and producer, as well as running their record label, National Youth Choir Recordings .

Josh maintains a busy schedule of work as a producer, conductor and baritone, working regularly in the UK’s top recording studios and concert halls. He also runs Endelium – an independent classical record label and distribution company, specialising in working with emerging artists and ensembles – and a number of other organisations & projects to be announced soon.
