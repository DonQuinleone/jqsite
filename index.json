There are of course many producers that still use a pencil and paper to write their take logs and annotate scores, and many engineers will loudly proclaim that their chosen DAW is ‘the best’. I’m not here to disagree with those people - after all, the most important thing is that everyone develops a system that works for them; however, I think we owe it to ourselves and our clients to always develop, optimise and improve our processes to increase our efficiency and make the experience for the artists as stress-free as possible.\nFor those that don’t necessarily care about the justification behind what tools I use and how I came to use them, I’ve included a summary at the bottom of the article.\nChallenges #When designing my workflow, there were a number of key things that I was looking to achieve and an array of challenges that I wanted to overcome. These are certainly not unique to me, however there are a few things that are specific to my situation that complicated matters somewhat.\nThe main challenge I’ve got is that I’m registered blind, so using hard copies of scores is particularly impossible for me – the font is too small to read, and using magnifiers and other LVAs (low vision aids) simply isn’t sufficient. Many years ago, the solution would have been to enlarge everything onto A3 paper, but given how much extra prep this would require (and how much paper it would use!), the solution seemed obvious – go digital…\nI certainly wouldn’t be the first musician to use an iPad in sessions. Indeed, I myself have been using forScore on an iPad since 2018, and it’s generally been a pretty solid experience. However, it’s not perfect.\nforScore is prone to crashing, particularly when viewing a particularly large score, or when annotating it whilst zoomed in. For obvious reasons, it cannot crash, otherwise that could interrupt the whole session. forScore has become a little more stable in recent years, but it’s still not perfect, and there are simply no other apps that come anywhere even close in terms of functionality. Where do I write take logs? Whilst the iPad has good multitasking functionality, I wanted to reduce the number of applications running on this device to ensure maximum stability and so that the entire screen shows the score. If the engineer isn’t using Pyramix (or another system that displays the current take number), how can I keep track of what take I’m currently on, in addition to other key bits of information like how many False Starts there have been? In addition to the problems raised above, I had a number of key objectives:\nEach part of my ‘system’ should work independently and be able to function apart from other components (i.e. the \u0026lsquo;Unix philosophy\u0026rsquo;). As much of my workflow should use open source software solutions as possible, avoiding proprietary software and vendor-locked SaaS solutions wherever possible. I knew that this wouldn’t be possible for everything (particularly in choosing DAWs), but using proprietary software should be a last resort. All components should be user-friendly and flexible so that they can fit the needs of any projects. Not all users (engineers, artists, stakeholders, etc.) will be advanced computer users, and the main priority is to make everyone’s lives easier, so the solution needs to, at the minimum, be as easy as the ‘established’ methods. As many components as possible should use standard file formats and be platform-agnostic such that it could be run from any device. At the review/approvals stage, there should be a clear audit trail showing who has reviewed what and when. This is primarily so I can be sure that the required sign-offs have been given and that there is clear evidence of this. E-mail should be avoided at all costs. Whilst I find e-mail fascinating and get a lot of enjoyment from maintaining my e-mail servers, it is not well-designed for this sort of process, so we should only fall back to using it when everything else is broken. I don’t want to have scroll back through a long e-mail thread with dozens of messages to realise that I’ve missed something, nor do I want my clients to have to do that – it’s tedious and a huge waste of time! That’s a lot of requirements! Of course, it didn’t start out that long – I’ve kept adding things to it as I’ve worked on my ‘setup’, and this is by no means an exhaustive list – but these are the core objectives that I wanted to meet in designing my workflow, and I believe that I’ve now succeeded in meeting all of them.\nFor the rest of the article, I will work through my process in chronological order starting from pre-production planning and ending with delivery \u0026amp; completion.\nSolution #Pre-Production #When a client books me to produce a session for them, the first details that I ascertain are:\nWhen and where is the session? Who is being recorded (ensemble, soloists, etc.)? What is being recorded (repertoire)? Who is on the production team (conductor(s), engineer(s), editor(s), etc.)? What are the key deadlines that need to be met, and what stakeholders are involved (executives, labels, etc. – i.e. who’s going to want to hear it before it’s signed off, and when do they need to hear it by)? Finances Any other details that may be relevant I store all of the above information (and much more) in my CRM - a heavily-customised deployment of the excellent open source CRM solution EspoCRM. This system allows me to plan out projects in detail and see at a glance where everything is up to.\nAt this stage, I also create entries in my customised InvoicePlane instance, ready to send out quotes and invoices as required.\nIn addition to this, I coordinate with the client’s management and the production team to produce schedules, stage plans, rigging diagrams, etc. in advance of the session so there are no surprises. What’s involved with these varies wildly depending on the amount of music, size of the ensemble and what the client’s objectives are.\nOf course, how much work is required at the planning stage very much depends on the project. Sometimes I book production staff and studio space on the client’s behalf, which is obviously quite a lot more involved, and sometimes this is all already done and I just need to turn up on the day. Whatever happens, I know that when I turn up I have all the information I need to make the day a success.\nAll additional documents, including stage plans, schedules, etc., are stored in a folder devoted to the project within my Nextcloud instance, Athena. It’s just a self-hosted alternative to the likes of Google Drive, Dropbox, etc., but I personally much prefer it – not only do I have complete control over all the data on my server, but I can also extend Nextcloud with the features that I need through custom-developed Apps.\nRecording day #Generally, I run two different systems on recording day:\na 12.9-inch iPad Pro Gen 5 an M4 Pro MacBook Pro (Late 2024 model) though the latter of these could really be anything – this just happens to be my primary machine at the moment.\nA photograph of a recent recording session with engineer David Jones and conductor Lucy Joy Morris I use the iPad to view the scores being recorded and make all of my annotations. I used to use the forScore app, but have recently switched to the native Preview app (introduced in the iPad OS 26 Developer Beta) and an Apple Pencil Gen 2. Aside from the fact that I’m doing things digitally, everything else is relatively standard – I use T-notation for denoting patch choices and overdubs, scrawl where I need a mark to jog my memory, and note down where takes start/end beneath the stave. I might write a separate post in the future about my annotation system.\nThe below is an example page from a score recorded in October 2024 – they don’t all look this neat (if you can even call this neat!):\nA screenshot of my annotated score for Jamie Powe\u0026rsquo;s Eros, as featured on NMC Young Composers 6 On my computer, I run a custom application called TakeLogger. It does what it says on the tin – it’s a take logger; that is, it lets me keep track of what take I’m currently on, how many false starts there have been, and any other notes that I’d like to record! It also has a countdown timer (telling me how long is left in the current session) and a clock (showing the current time), both there to ensure that I stick to time. I’m working on DAW integration at the moment so this kind of information can be captured automatically, but it does the job for now\nHere’s the ‘take log’ from the same session that included the score above:\nA screenshot of the TakeLogger session for the Jamie Powe piece featured above In addition to TakeLogger, I usually have the CRM open so I can view the list of artists for the session and any notes that I’ve taken. I would ordinarily place this on a secondary monitor so it’s always visible to me.\nAt the end of the session, a data exchange happens. If I’m editing, I’ll either take a copy of the session files or just the audio files on a portable SSD, or the engineer will send the files to me via Athena, WeTransfer or another similar solution. If I’m not editing, I upload the annotated scores and my take logs to Athena and send them to the editor.\nEditing #For this section, let’s assume that I’m the one editing. I won’t linger too much here because my workflow is largely the same as everyone else’s.\nMy DAW of choice is MAGIX Sequoia. Similar to other options like Pyramix and SADiE, the thing that makes Sequoia so powerful is Source-Destination Editing – a supercharged editing workflow that lets you compile complete edits effortlessly. The main concept is that you have two main areas – the Source (all of your raw takes), and the Destination (your compiled edit) – and you send your chosen takes from the Source area to the Destination area with a keyboard shortcut. This, in addition to other must-have features like ripple editing (an edit where all the surrounding content is adjusted automatically) and an extremely comprehensive crossfade editor, can cumulatively save hours of editing when putting together a larger project; importantly, it also negates the RSI that can be induced by the editing workflows in other programmes like Pro Tools when working on a large classical project involving hundreds or thousands of edits!. Whenever I’m doing a classical project, Sequoia is my go-to, and never lets me down! Why I chose this over Pyramix and SADiE is a more interesting conversation, and perhaps for another time.\nA photography of the Sequoia session for Joanna Marsh\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;Word\u0026rsquo; Having pointed out one of the flaws of Pro Tools, many people therefore wonder why Avid Pro Tools Studio is my second DAW of choice…\nPut simply, it is by far the best option when recording anything to click and/or dealing with large channel counts. It’s stable, incredibly flexible and consistent across every installation, and it’s so prevalent in recording studios that I can turn up at any session and immediately know what’s going on. More specifically, the editing workflow when comping together an edit of a track that was recorded to click is utterly superb – completely intuitive and efficient once you’ve learnt the keyboard shortcuts. I also tend to stick to editing in Pro Tools when the session was recorded in Pro Tools; of course, I could copy all the files over to Sequoia, but I generally find that I’m a good way through the edit by the time that I would’ve finished setting up the Sequoia session, so I usually don’t bother.\nA photography of the Pro Tools session for Ben Parry\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;One Long Song\u0026rsquo; In terms of plugins, I generally keep things quite minimal. My reverb of choice is Valhalla Room – an inexpensive but high quality option, in my opinion – and my go to equalizer and compressor are both by FabFilter – Pro-Q 3 and Pro-C 2 respectively. Of course, Melodyne is a must-have now-a-days too, though I try to use it as little as possible. For de-noising, I use a combination of iZotope RX and Steinberg SpectraLayers – they’re both great and I use each for different things, though the bulk of my time is spent in RX. Lastly, for DDP creation I tend to use HOFA CD-Burn DDP Master, along with MP3tag for BEXT chunk authoring and MP3 tagging where needed.\nI also like to be able to be hands-on when mixing sessions, so I use a PreSonus FaderPort 16 to make life a bit easier. I don’t use it on every session, but when working on big projects, it can save lots of time, especially where lots of volume automation is needed. Other hardware includes an SSL 2+ and a Focusrite Scarlett 18i20 Gen 3, along with assorted headphones (mostly from Beyerdynamic, Sony and Sennheiser), and I use both Dante and Rogue Amoeba’s Loopback for audio routing on the network and in-machine respectively.\nOf course, a big part of the editing process is going out to stakeholders for their feedback, and that’s what we’ll discuss next.\nCollecting and acting on stakeholder feedback #One of the key things that I wanted to get right in my workflow was the experience for stakeholders, whether they’re conductors, performers, engineers, label reps or otherwise. The typical workflow that I’ve observed involves:\nEditor completes the first edit Editor sends the first edit to whoever needs to receive it via WeTransfer Recipient responds to the editor via e-mail Repeat ad infinitum Circa 25 e-mails later (usually not in the same thread), stakeholders confirm that they’re all happy via e-mail and the editor sends the masters to the client via WeTransfer Occasionally you’ll come across someone that uses a spreadsheet and Dropbox to make this process a little simpler, but that’s rare in my experience. Needless to say, this system is riddled with inefficiencies and opportunities for problems, so I thought I’d come up with something better.\nThis isn’t intended to be a critique of people that use WeTransfer, Dropbox or similar services, nor of anybody using the workflow mentioned above – I was doing this myself until Spring 2024, and they are great services! I’m merely trying to point out the problems of the above, and how we can get around them. The main problems that I observed are:\nReliance on third-party, often expensive, services that you have no control over. Stakeholders need to download every version of the track With particularly sensitive projects, it isn’t ideal that the track is being downloaded at all It isn’t easy to compare between different versions Unless you’re incredibly organised with file storage, it’s easy to get versions mixed up It’s difficult to keep track of who has received the track, when it was opened (if it was at all), and whether it was shared any wider than intended E-mails, or even spreadsheets, are not an ideal way to receive feedback. What if you want to respond to a particular comment, or other stakeholders want to? What if you want to mark particular comments as being done, or mark them as “won’t fix”? You can’t easily do either. There is no centralised ‘source of truth’ that everyone can rely on, meaning that you have to dig back through e-mail threads to figure out what’s gone on. When planning how I was going to resolve all of the above, there were two industries that I looked to for inspiration – film production and software development. Both industries have very clearly established production/development processes and technologies that can be used to support those processes. In software development, SCM (source control management, e.g. Git) and Agile/Scrum are used to organise tasks and keep track of who has down what and when, and in the film industry there are clear feedback/approval pipelines that need to be followed before any asset is delivered. Neither industry has a solution that perfectly fits our needs here, but both show how technology can be used to make collaborative projects like ours run more efficiently.\nThere are many proprietary / SaaS solutions available that could be used to automate our processes – for example, both Frame.io and FileStage are excellent solutions, and would largely achieve what we’re looking for; however, these solutions are very expensive, are closed source, aren’t designed specifically for our use case, and most importantly come with the big problem that is vendor lock-in. I don’t want to be in the situation where a company goes bust and I lose all my data, nor do I want to be forced to pay more in the situation that a provider increases their prices. Furthermore, I greatly appreciate being able to self-host my solutions, giving me fine-grained control over how data is used, and allowing me to choose the hardware \u0026amp; software stack that the service is being run on. It would also be great if this solution could be open source, but that’s not a deal-breaker at this point – I don’t have the time to write something completely bespoke, and it’s unlikely that something open source exists that meets all my requirements.\nAs someone that’s been hosting my own solutions for many years, I’m not averse to interacting with and administering servers, whether they run on-premise or in the cloud. In this case, I chose to host this instance in the cloud since it would give me greater reliability, easy-expendability and much greater network performance.\nSo, I had decided that I wanted to self-host something, and that I wanted to run it in the cloud. Now I just needed to find the right application…\nIntroducing Kollaborate – a tool that is mostly designed for video projects, but works just as well for audio projects. When I stumbled across this solution, I immediately requested a trial license, spun up a server and got it installed. An hour or so later, QReview was born, and I haven’t looked back since.\nQReview, my Kollaborate instance, is a fully-online review/approval system that addresses all of the problems raised above. It allows for engineers to securely upload new versions of tracks and for stakeholders to leave comments on \u0026amp; approve/reject new edits, all without the need to send a single e-mail. Feedback is marked with the timecode at which it was submitted, meaning that you can easily jump to the exact point in reference, and because versions of tracks are linked you can quickly compare the changes between versions. In addition to all of this, there are fine-grained permissions for both reviewers (that are accessing the track via a unique share link) and users (that have direct access to the system), meaning that I can define who can upload/download files, who can comment, who can read comments, and who can approve/reject versions. Plus, it works with audio, video and images, and even has support for complex encoding workflows on ingest (which I am currently experimenting with).\nHere’s what the interface looks like:\nA screenshot of a file in QReview This is the single most game-changing tool that I’ve implemented, and my clients and colleagues seem to love it almost as much as I do! It’s helped to make what has traditionally been quite a time-intensive, stressful process involving lots of back-and-forth over e-mail into something that can really be enjoyed. No, it’s not open source (which isn’t ideal), but it is at least hosted on my own servers, and I can access everything (files, database, metadata, etc.) over SSH/SFTP, so ultimately if I wanted to change to a different package I could and I wouldn’t lose anything.\nAnd here’s the real kicker: I can do all of this for less than the cost of a Dropbox plan (after the initial cost of a Kollaborate license). That’s a win-win if you ask me…\nSummary #Getting to this point has been quite the journey and has involved lots of trial-and-error, but I’m delighted with the end result. It really works for me, and I feel that it really works for my clients too. Of course, I will never stop looking for ways to improve my processes and systems to make the experience even better, but I’m happy with where everything is at right now, which is a great position to be in.\nHere’s a quick TL;DR of the technologies being used:\nDAWs of choice: MAGIX Sequoia (primary choice for classical recordings) and Avid Pro Tools Studio (for any recordings done to click or with high channel count) Score reading software: Preview (on iPad) Take logging software: TakeLogger (custom built open source application) Stakeholder review/approvals system: QReview (extended/customised version of Kollaborate Server) File storage: Athena (Nextcloud instance), with copies stored on a NAS for quick local access E-mail: Hermes (self-hosted, using Postfix, Dovecot and other open source components) CRM: Customised version of EspoCRM Billing/invoicing: InvoicePlane Computer systems: MacBook Pro M4 Pro (Late 2024) (primary machine) and a custom-built machine dual-booting Windows and Arch Linux for running Sequoia \u0026amp; other specialist applications.

It will either be in an e-mail that comes directly from me, or an automated e-mail sent by the platform (from review-no-reply@quinlan.cloud). In either case, keep your link safe as it’s unique to you and won’t change throughout the project, though of course we can send it to you again if needed.\nTo access QReview, simply click on your link and you’ll be taken to one of two pages: a file tree or the player for a particular file.\nYou must not share your unique link with anybody else. All access to QReview is logged. If there is somebody else that you believe should have access to the file, please contact me and we can discuss it.\nQReview is designed to be accessed from a desktop computer/laptop Whilst it is possible to use QReview on a mobile phone or tablet, it has been optimised for desktop usage. As such, it is strongly recommended that you access QReview using a desktop computer/laptop on a reliable internet connection, not on a mobile connection. Using the player #In most cases, when you click your unique QReview link, you’ll be taken straight to the Player. You’ll see a screen that looks like this:\nA screenshot of the player in QReview The first thing that you should do is set your name where indicated below the “Comments” header on the right hand side.\nOnce you’ve set your name, a text box will appear where you can enter your request/query.\nLet’s go through each of the components shown on the page.\nA screenshot of the player in QReview with added annotations Left pane - File info \u0026amp; playback #In the top left, you’ll see the filename which will be formatted as: BounceDate_TrackTitle_EditNumber\nBounceDate: The date that the version was exported/bounced TrackTitle: The title of the piece EditNumber: Formatted EXXX (starting E101), this is a chronological number assigned to each version. Beneath this, you’ll see text like “Version 2” with a dropdown arrow. This aligns with the EditNumber in the file name (EXXX); clicking on this will open a dropdown menu that allows you to select another version.\nA screenshot of the version selector in QReview When you change edit versions using the Version Selector, your current playback position will be retained, which means that you can easily compare multiple versions. Your unique link will always link you to the latest version of the track.\nTaking up the majority of the space in this pane is a graphical representation of the file (waveform) and media controls. These work like on any standard media player.\nYou may occasionally be given access to other functions (e.g. downloading files). Buttons to access these features will appear at the bottom of this pane.\nRight pane - Feedback #If you have been given access to post comments on files, you will see another pane on the right hand side. This functions like the comments system on social media sites and YouTube.\nTo add a new comment, firstly make sure that you have the right point selected in the media player – the current timecode is linked to the comment for easy review.\nThen, enter your comment and hit enter to submit it.\nIf you need to edit or delete a comment that you’ve submitted, hover over it, click the dropdown arrow in the top right of the comment box and click the desired action. You will only be able to submit an action for a comment that has been made by you.\nA screenshot showing the actions dropdown for a comment Should you wish to respond to a comment, click the Reply arrow in the bottom right of the comment, and the comment composer will be updated accordingly. When submitting a reply, it will appear below the comment being responded to, just like on social media platforms.\nA screenshot of the \u0026lsquo;Reply\u0026rsquo; button for a comment in QReview Guidance on giving feedback #When writing comments, please make sure to include the following:\nWhere? Though we can reference the timecode, it will save us a lot of time if you can also include a bar reference. If you’re referring to a specific beat, please specify the bar number and beat (e.g. bar 52, beat 4). What’s the issue? Please clearly describe the problem so we can quickly identify what you would like to be changed. If something doesn’t sound right but you can’t put your finger on it, that’s fine – just try to describe what you’re hearing as clearly as possible. What is your desired action? This could mean asking us to check for a new take, adjusting the mix, or something else. If you have a general comment that is not associated with a specific time/bar, please leave these at the beginning or end of the track.\nYou do not need to:\nMention any matters pertaining to noise (clicks, bumps, coughs, grumbles, hiss, etc.). This will all be addressed following the editing process, and does not require your input (unless specifically requested). Give any technical recommendations. Please describe the issue and what you are looking to achieve. If you have an idea of how to deal with that, please feel free to suggest it, but it is absolutely not a requirement. Leave that to us! Leave positive feedback in QReview, though feel free to send over any positive feedback via e-mail/message (that’s always nice!). The reason for this is that QReview is specifically used for to-do items and actions, and having non-actionable feedback, however nice, disrupts the process. Navigating the file tree #Rather than pointing directly to a file, your unique link may point towards a folder or a project, in which case you will need to navigate the file tree in order use the player.\nA screenshot of the file tree for a project in QReview This works pretty much like any standard file explorer. Select a file/folder to open it, and you will be taken to the player or deeper into the file tree respectively.\nColour-coding #To make it quickly apparent where in the edit process a file/folder currently is, a number of colours are used.\nBlack / no background colour = In the backlog / being edited Yellow = Edit complete, pending sign-off Pink = Approved / signed off, pending mastering Green = Mixed, mastered and delivered A screenshot of the file tree in QReview shocasing possible colours Should you have any issues with using QReview or have any questions in general, please do not hesitate to get in touch. This system exists to make everyones’ lives easier, so if something isn’t working for you, let me know so I can fix it!\n","date":"3 September, 2024","permalink":"https://joshquinlan.co.uk/help-guides/using-qreview-to-submit-stakeholder-feedback/","section":"Help-Guides","summary":"","title":"Using QReview to submit stakeholder feedback"},{"content":" \u0026lt; Back to Discography\nRole Distributor Artists Jo Harris (trumpet) Producer Rosanna Goodall Engineer Chris Kalkov Label Endelium Records \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e Listen on Spotify Listen on Apple Music ","date":"29 August, 2024","permalink":"https://joshquinlan.co.uk/discography/enter-ghost/","section":"Discography","summary":"Role: Distributor\u003cbr\u003e Jo Harris (trumpet)\u003cbr\u003e Released on Endelium Records","title":"enter GHOST"},{"content":" \u0026lt; Back to Discography\nRole Producer Client National Youth Choir Artists National Youth Choir (9-15 Years - Female \u0026amp; Non-Binary Voices)\nKrystal Tunnicliffe (piano)\nJoanna Tomlinson (conductor) Engineer David Jones Label National Youth Choir Recordings \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e Listen on Spotify Listen on Apple Music View on Label Website ","date":"16 August, 2024","permalink":"https://joshquinlan.co.uk/discography/quartel-grow/","section":"Discography","summary":"Role: Producer\u003cbr\u003e National Youth Choir (9-15 Years - Female \u0026amp; Non-Binary Voices)\u003cbr\u003e Released on National Youth Choir Recordings","title":"Quartel: Grow"},{"content":" \u0026lt; Back to Discography\nRole Additional Mastering \u0026amp; De-Noising Client National Youth Choirs of Great Britain Artists National Youth Choir of Great Britain\nLisa Graham (conductor) Engineer \u0026amp; Producer John Rutter Label National Youth Choir Recordings \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e Listen on Spotify Listen on Apple Music View on Label Website ","date":"19 July, 2024","permalink":"https://joshquinlan.co.uk/discography/lauridsen-soneto/","section":"Discography","summary":"Role: Additional Mastering \u0026amp; Denoising\u003cbr\u003e National Youth Choir of Great Britain \u0026amp; Lisa Graham (conductor)\u003cbr\u003e Released on National Youth Choir Recordings","title":"Lauridsen: Nocturnes: II.

Originally from Liverpool, he has been registered blind since birth due to Oculocutaneous Albinism — a lived experience that has shaped his sensitivity to sound and deep musical instinct.\nJosh specialises in working with choirs, vocal ensembles and singers, with a particular interesting in recording new music. His passion lies in capturing the emotional immediacy and detail of live performance, while preserving the acoustic integrity of the space in which it was performed. His production style is defined by clarity, depth, and a naturalistic sound — one that respects the performers’ artistry without overproduction.\nAn experienced choral musician himself, Josh brings a performer\u0026rsquo;s insight to the studio. Having sung in countless concerts and recording sessions, he understands both the technical demands and emotional nuance of performance. This dual perspective enables him to support and communicate with singers effectively while delivering recordings of the highest quality.\nHe began his musical training at the Royal Northern College of Music’s Junior Department, studying singing, conducting, composition, and clarinet, before earning a First-Class Honours degree in Music from the University of York.\nJosh has worked with a wide range of renowned ensembles and organisations. He was selected for the prestigious Glyndebourne Academy, where he received mentorship as a young soloist of exceptional potential. At eighteen, he made his conducting debut at the Royal Albert Hall, performing his own music with young musician\u0026rsquo;s from Royal Liverpool Philharmonic (who were also the commissioner). He is presently a Young Conductor on National Youth Choir\u0026rsquo;s Emerging Professional Artists Programme. Performance highlights include appearances at the BBC Proms, the Royal Variety Performance, and the Royal Albert Hall’s 150th Anniversary Concert.\nJosh is also the founder of Endelium Records - an independent classical label and distribution company supporting emerging artists and ensembles, with a focus on choral and vocal repertoire. Through this and his work managing National Youth Choir\u0026rsquo;s in-house record label, National Youth Choir Recordings, he continues to advocate for new music, nurture creative talent, and broaden access to professional recording opportunities within the choral field.\nA full discography is available on this site.\n","date":"21 July, 2016","permalink":"https://joshquinlan.co.uk/about/","section":"","summary":"","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://joshquinlan.co.uk/articles/","section":"Articles","summary":"","title":"Articles"},{"content":"The best way to get in contact with me is via e-mail.\nI always try to reply within 24 hours.
